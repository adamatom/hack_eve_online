# Eve Online market bot

Reverse engineered and decompiled Eve Online game client code (written in
Python) to inject arbitrary Python scripts that had access to Eve Online
in-game APIs. Used the internal game API to build in-game tooling (including
GUI) for finding arbitrage trading opportunities within the in-game stock
markets. Wrote a knapsack problem solver to maximize in-game profits when
moving items between markets with limited cargo space. Won Eve when I had more
money than I knew what to do with.
